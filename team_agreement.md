### Conflict Plan
#### Process to resolve conflict
1. Votes shall be decided by a majority and the team shall try to incorporate 
   aspects of the dissenting votes.
2. Bring up issues as they arise rather than waiting.
3. Discuss conflict in a civilized manner. Objective is to make sure that we 
   understand the root of the conflict.
4. If a majority of the team agreed on conflict resolution, then conflict is 
   resolved.
5. If each team member has a different opinion about the resolution or a 
   situation arises that is not solvable among team members, then the team 
   will get a mediator.
6. If one person takes over the project, it is the responsibility of the other 
   team members to follow the conflict plan and address the situation.
7. As team members we will leverage each other's strengths,while balancing what 
   we want to get out of the project and completing the work on a timely manner.
8. In cases where we have knowledge gaps and not enough time to learn, we will 
   together decide the balance between learning and coding.
9. If a member is not adequately contributing, the other team members will  
   have a respectful conversation to understand the situation and asked for 
   a change in output.
10. If point 1 and 2 of conflict plan fails, then team will escalate conflict to 
    mediator.

### Communication Plan
#### Hours available
* Marni: Class hours, plus other pre-arranged hours.
* Brendon: Group availability outside work hours, issue availability 24/7
* Aoife: Class hours, plus other pre-arranged hours.  Fridays and Sundays 
  not guaranteed.
* Sergii: Class hours, plus other pre-arranged hours.  Fridays and Sundays 
  not guaranteed.
* Brian: Class hours, plus other pre-arranged hours.  Not available Sundays.

Team will be fully available at class time, plus other pre-arranged times. In 
addition, team will also meet at pre-arrange hours. The team will agree 
together on additional hours. The forms of communication include Remo and 
Slack. We will take breaks as often as needed. If we start to fall behind 
the team will re-prioritize and split tasks. The assignment of tasks may be 
based on individual strengths. The practice of open and mutual respect at all 
conversations will ensure that all voices are heard.

If an individual works on a section of code alone, they will inform the 
entire team at the next stand-up what was done and how to ensure all team 
members understand the code.  Tasks delegated to an individual shall be 
minimized, as much as possible, and not be major functionality.

### Work Plan
#### Project Management Tool: GitHub Projects
* Task identification: Team will decide major tasks.  Individual will decide 
  sub-tasks. 
* Task assignments: Team will decide as a group who wants to take on each task.

### Git Process
* Components that will be on GitHub:
  * Production (main) branch
  * Staging branch
  * Individual contributor branches

* Repository sharing will be done via an organization on GitHub.

* Git Flow:
  1. Individual pushes changes up to their contributor branch.
  2. Individual performs a pull request from contributor branch to staging 
     branch.
  3. Two other team members look at the contribution.  One of these members 
     will merge the pull request from the contributor branch to staging branch.
  4. Team reviews changes and merge into production branch after all code is 
     staged and tested only after MVP is achieved.
